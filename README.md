# MachineLearning
This repo is for the documentation and the learnings i get from all the videos and documents I read on ML

I have been seeing this trend of people getting involved but are clueless when to start and how to .
Even I am . So I will be documenting my journey to see how well or worse I become at this thing and lets give it a shot!

I will be using the main things like github , YT , MIT lectures , some other papers and will be linking all of them and how I go about the terrain traversing them 

I would summarise what I learnt today

Type of machine learning systems .

Based on human supervision 
Supervised - unsupervised - semisupervised - Reinforcemment learning 

Online vs Batch Learning 

instance-based versus model-based learning

Lets see from Supervised/unsupervised/semisupervised/Reinforcement Learning
